# Ex1: Write a NumPy program to reverse an array (first element becomes last).
# Input: [12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37]

# Ex2: Write a NumPy program to test whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a second array
# Input Array1: [ 0 10 20 40 60]
#       Array2: [10, 30, 40]

# Ex3: Write a NumPy program to find the indices of the maximum and minimum values along the given axis of an array
# Input Array [1,6,4,8,9,-4,-2,11]

# Ex4: Read the entire file story.txt and write a program to print out top 100 words occur most
